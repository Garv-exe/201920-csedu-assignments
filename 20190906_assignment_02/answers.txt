1. What does python do if you provide the value 0 for a?

Python reports an error "ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero", as the equation
divides by a.

2. What does python do if $b^2 - 4ac < 0$?

Python splits the answer into non-imaginary and imaginary numbers, by giving a tuple(?)
of a + b * j, representing the imaginary number of square root of -1 as j.

3. What does python do if you provide a value for a, b, or c that cannot be converted 
to a number?

Python reports an error "ValueError: could not convert string to float."

4. Handling each of the above problems is an aspect of data validation. This is the process
of ensuring data meets general specifications for a problem. Why is this process important
when creating programs such as this one?

This process is important for programs such as this one as unmatching data types would be
invalid. For instance, it does not make sense to do a math equation with string inputs.
