1. What does python do if you provide the value 0 for a?

Python reports an error "ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero", as the equation
divides by a.

2. What does python do if $b^2 - 4ac < 0$?

Python splits the answer into non-imaginary and imaginary numbers, by giving a tuple(?)
of a + b * j, representing the imaginary number of square root of -1 as j.

3. What does python do if you provide a value for a, b, or c that cannot be converted 
to a number?
